# Legacy Support

If you are using a Legacy BDS version (1.16.20 - 1.16.210), those are replacement `sigcache.txt`s if the default Legacy one doesn't have full support

Keep in mind those have low priority, and are not guaranteed to fully work.

For example, if you want 1.16.201 support, grab the `sigcache_1.16.201.txt` and rename it to `sigcache_LEGACY.txt`, replace it in the `Platinum` directory, turn off use legacy version in the `settings.txt`

If you want to use legacy versions over 1.16.201, then turn on the use legacy version, and rename it to `sigcache.txt` instead of `sigcache_LEGACY.txt` for best results.
